# Anki Bible Stats Server

A simple web server (and CLI tool) for getting Anki stats from an Anki database (such as one managed by the self-hosted Anki server). This project as a whole is specifically designed for my Bible memorization workflow, with specific deck names and card types hardcoded. So it probably wouldn't be useful for someone else to directly use. But I like open-sourcing things I work on to share and showcase what I build and in case any specific bits might be useful, such as as Anki database querying.

### My AI Coding Policy

I have used Claude Code to work on this codebase. I do not do vibe coding; Claude Code is able to write around 90% of the code, but I am actively engaging with the tool to plan and develop, and actively reviewing and refining what it produces. I take responsibility for every commit and line of code that I ship, and will review all code an AI tool produces to ensure it is correct and that I understand how it works.
